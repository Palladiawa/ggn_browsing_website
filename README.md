Automatically Browsing GGn
'Do be very careful with the browsing speed! or you will get banned in hours!'

I just got a mg from my friend who got banned by the ggn. So do be careful using this script.
You can change the speed and the browser so the manager won't suspect you.


And sadly, I just got a mg from a second friend that he got banned by the ggn because of starring my project. So do be very careful, if you have the name ressemble to ggn's. Feel free to follow me or star this project if different.

    This project is enlightened by https://bitbucket.org/pythunder/ggn-torrents-downloader/src/master/
    But the project above has closed because of some bitches. I am very sad to say I have been considering to open a backup for torrents-downloader.
